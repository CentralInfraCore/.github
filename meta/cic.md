# What is this file?

This metadata file describes the core logic, entrypoints and components of the CentralInfraCore (CIC) system.
It is intended to provide both humans and AI systems with:

* a high-level model of what the system does
* what major components exist
* how those relate to documents and schema logic

## Role in the CIC knowledge graph

This file acts as the root `meta/cic.yaml` node in the CIC knowledge relay.
Its structure is designed to be parseable, verifiable, and mappable across CLI, UI, or AI-based exploration.
