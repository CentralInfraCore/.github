# What is CentralInfraCore (CIC)?

CentralInfraCore (CIC) is a next-generation infrastructure definition system that combines **state-centric reasoning**, **schema-driven execution**, and **AI-assisted interpretation**. Itâ€™s not just a tool â€” itâ€™s a thinking model, driven by relays, graphs, and structured knowledge.

## ðŸŽ¯ What Problems Does CIC Solve?

* Replaces static YAML with **knowledge-driven state descriptors**
* Executes change through **schema-bound relay logic**, not scripts
* Designed to be **machine-navigable and AI-cooperative**
* All state is **versioned, validated, and traceable**

---

## ðŸ§± Core Building Blocks

### State Model

Three layers: declared, derived, observed â€” all system logic builds on this.

### Schema

Not just a data format, but an **interpretation contract** behind every object and prompt.

### Relay Execution

All state transitions occur through relay chains â€” **graph-driven, not linear**.

### Modularity

Every component is versioned and recomposable â€” **nothing is hardwired**.

### AI Support

Prompt-indexed, schema-aware, relay-driven â€” **AI can navigate and explain**.

## ðŸ§ª PoC Scope Today

* Self-signed certificate flow via relays
* Basic declared â†’ validated â†’ relayed pipeline
* Schema versioning with validation
* AI index support (e.g. `_ai_prompt_index.yaml`, `.explained.md`)

### Whatâ€™s Still Hidden (Future)

* Multi-relay orchestration
* Role-based prompt routing
* Full lifecycle rollout control
* Self-healing + rollback workflows

---

## ðŸ‘¥ Who Is CIC For?

* Platform engineers tired of hand-crafted YAMLs
* Architects seeking verifiable, auditable execution
* AI-based documentation or training systems
* Anyone looking beyond current DevOps abstractions

---

## ðŸŒ± Closing Thought

CIC is not just a framework â€” it is a **directed system**:

* State expresses intent
* Schema interprets context
* Relay decides action
* AI learns meaning

This is just the beginning.

*Created in collaboration with AI. A PoC driven by structured intent.*
