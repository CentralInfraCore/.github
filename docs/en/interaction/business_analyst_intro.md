# Business Analyst – The system doesn't lie, unless it's misunderstood

## 🎯 What you see isn't data. It's state.

In CIC, every action, connection, and decision is **represented through state and schema**. As a Business Analyst, you're the one who interprets this into **impact, dependency, and consequence**.

This is not ticket management. This is a **behavioral model**, where the system *documents itself* — and you get to see it.

---

## 📊 What does CIC give you as a BA?

* **State-based transparency** – not just what happened, but *why*.
* **Versioned decisions** – when something changed, what was affected, and by whom.
* **Traceability** – who validated or rejected what, and when.
* **Context** – not isolated events, but chains of relation.

---

## 📌 Where do you come in?

* **Impact analysis** – if something changes, what else is affected?
* **Rule enforcement** – if it's not described, it can't enter the system.
* **Operational feedback** – the system provides feedback based on its own state.

---

## 🔍 What should you pay attention to?

* Use `state-snapshot`, `change-log`, and `validation-path` views.
* Think in structures: don't analyze events, analyze graphs.
* Ask: **"Why did this happen?"** — and the system will show you.

---

## 💡 Why does this matter to you?

* Because your system doesn't express opinion — it shows verified state.
* Because you don't have to reverse-engineer what happened — just interpret logic.
* Because CIC is not ad hoc — it's *consistent and traceable*.

---

This is not a report. It's **intelligent infrastructure** that not only runs, but *makes sense*.
If you want to interpret, not just list — this system is built for you.
