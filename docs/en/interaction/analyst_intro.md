# Analyst – Why you?

## ✨ The system sees — but you understand

CIC doesn’t just move data — it interprets state. This document isn’t a technical guide, but **a gateway into a world where the analyst’s role is critical**. The question isn’t “what’s happening now?”, but: **“why is this happening — and how exactly like this?”**

If you’re the one who notices the anomaly, who doesn’t just request a report but wants to interpret what it means — this is for you.

## 🔎 What do you get from CIC?

* Full state space: every entity, relation, and current vs. expected state captured in structure.
* Change log: all modifications are traceable, timestamped, and validated.
* Schema-driven data surface: no ad hoc sources — only structured output.
* Reflexive fault handling: not just detection, but **causal reaction paths**.

---

## 📊 What can you do as an analyst?

* **Audit the system’s logic**: not just the event, but its validated cause-effect chain.
* **Generate state space mappings**: what’s functioning right now, and what it depends on.
* **Detect drift-prone dependencies**: components that still work but are no longer schema- or policy-consistent.

## 🔗 What should you focus on?

* Don’t seek raw logs — seek context: state or causal chain.
* Use `state-diff`, `schema-view`, `relay-trace` exports.
* Don’t just ask “when did it happen?” — ask: **“what was it a consequence of?”**

## 🎯 Where does this help you?

* In incident reviews: what was the actual precursor?
* In impact analysis: if we change this, what breaks downstream?
* In audits: you can demonstrate that the system **made decisions based on validated state**.

This isn’t a dashboard. This is a **system-level mirror**.
If you're an analyst — this is your map.
