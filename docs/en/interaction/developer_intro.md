# Developer – You don’t have to know everything, just don’t be the source of the error

## 💡 You’re not building the world. You’re fitting into a form.

CIC doesn’t help you make fewer mistakes — it ensures **your mistakes never make it into the system**.

As a developer, you don’t need to know how the relay works, what validation logic is in the policy, or what the auditlog looks like. You just need to make sure **what you deliver is described, interpretable, and valid**.

---

## 🧩 What do you gain from thinking in CIC terms?

* **No "how"** — only "what must exist".
* **No need for env files, config maps, or init scripts** — the system *tells* your service what it gets.
* **No need to fear regression** — if it’s not valid, it doesn’t get in.
* **No need to explain “what your service is”** — your declaration *defines itself*.

---

## ✍️ What does the system expect from you?

* A clear, schema-conformant structure.
* Declared input and output interfaces.
* Not a workaround, but understandable behavior.

Don’t hack your environment. Declare what you need.
CIC delivers.

## 🧠 What happens to your declaration?

* The schema validates it.
* The relay transmits it.
* The state compares it to what’s live.
* The output is logged, traceable, and reflected back to you.

This isn’t a CI pipeline. This is **operational reality**.

---

## 🎯 Why is this good for you?

* No more endless debugging.
* The system tells you what’s wrong *before* it’s deployed.
* You can always look back at **what the input was, what the intent was, and what the outcome became**.

This isn’t a constraint. This is **a map of your intent**.
And from now on, *only what matches that map can enter.*
