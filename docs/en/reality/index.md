# Reality Layer â€“ Overview

This document provides an overview of the **reality layer** in the CentralInfraCore (CIC) system. This layer defines how the system interacts with the actual state of infrastructure objects and describes the execution logic of state-driven operations.

## ðŸ§© Core Components

### 1. [Relay â€“ Execution and Forwarding Logic](relay.md)

Relays are schema-driven nodes that validate, apply, and forward state transitions. They define directed flows between modules and evaluators.

### 2. [State â€“ Declarative State Model](state.md)

State is a layered structure: declared, derived, and observed. This model supports drift detection and declarative remediation.

### 3. [Schema â€“ Structural and Semantic Contracts](schema.md)

Schemas define the required structure, default inheritance, and validation rules for all objects. They enable predictable, modular, and testable system logic.

### 4. [Error Handling â€“ Relay Feedback and Recovery](error.md)

Errors in CIC are structured, propagatable, and usable in AI workflows. They support guided resolution instead of failure.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why It Matters

The reality layer provides the **technical and semantic foundation** for:

* precise state inspection and validation
* reproducible, schema-bound execution flows
* safe relay transitions with full context
* AI-guided feedback and correction
