# Error Handling in CIC

In CentralInfraCore (CIC), error handling is not an afterthought — it's a first-class mechanism embedded in the relay-based execution logic. The goal is not merely to emit an error, but to provide **interpretable feedback and consequence-driven resolution**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* **Structured errors**: Errors are structured objects, not just messages
* **Relay feedback**: Errors can propagate backward via relays
* **AI integrability**: Errors can trigger prompts or contextual learning

---

## 🧱 Error Types

### 1. **Schema Errors**

* Missing or invalid fields in declarations
* Incompatible types or mutually exclusive attributes

### 2. **State Errors**

* Observed state diverges from declared, but correction is blocked
* Derived state computation failed

### 3. **Relay Errors**

* Undefined route or relay endpoint
* Missing required relay headers (e.g. version)

### 4. **Execution Errors**

* Downstream module or renderer is unreachable
* External system failure or inconsistent response

## 🔁 Error Propagation Path

```plaintext
error occurs → relayed backward → upstream state goal updated or warning issued
```

Errors do **not crash the system** — they become traceable, structured events.

## 🧠 AI and Error Handling

* Structured errors can **trigger AI prompts** ("Why did relay X fail?")
* Errors can become **training data** for knowledge graph enrichment
* Contextual **guides or workflows** can be mapped to known error patterns

---

## Summary

CIC treats errors not as terminal faults but as **semantic flow controls** — relayed, interpretable, and improvable. This enables human and AI actors to adapt and learn from failure.
